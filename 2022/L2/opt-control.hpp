 *
 * Note that this function does not imply that the value is *modified*
 * which means that a compiler may assume the value is unchanged across
 * it. This means that code on either side of the sink that deals with
 * the sunk value can still be optimized, as long as the correct value
 * is somehow "produced" for each call to sink. If you don't want that,
 * you might be looking for modify() instead.
 *
 * The actual sink implementation is empty and
 * so usually leaves no trace in the generated code except that the
 * value will be calculated.
 *
 * Currently, only primitive ("arithmetic") values are accepted, for
 * classes and pointers we need to think more about the meaning of
 * sinking a value.
